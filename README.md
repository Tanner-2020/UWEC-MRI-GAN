Contributors: Tanner Hall, Elena Bourget, Kayla Behnke

This research is designed to implement and evaluate several different strategies of image generation
for the creation of MRI brain scans and their use in training the accuracy of a convolutional neural networks
designed to detect if an image contains a tumor in it in order to assist medical professionals.
